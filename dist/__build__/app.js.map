For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n    return converter ?\n      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n      fromJSDefault(json);\n  }\n\n  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function isPlainObj(value) {\n    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n  }\n\n  var src_Math__imul =\n    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n    Math.imul :\n    function imul(a, b) {\n      a = a | 0; // int\n      b = b | 0; // int\n      var c = a & 0xffff;\n      var d = b & 0xffff;\n      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n    };\n\n  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n  // the sign bit.\n  function smi(i32) {\n    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n  }\n\n  function hash(o) {\n    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n      o = o.valueOf();\n      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n        return 0;\n      }\n    }\n    if (o === true) {\n      return 1;\n    }\n    var type = typeof o;\n    if (type === 'number') {\n      var h = o | 0;\n      if (h !== o) {\n        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n      }\n      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n        h ^= o;\n      }\n      return smi(h);\n    }\n    if (type === 'string') {\n      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n    }\n    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n      return o.hashCode();\n    }\n    return hashJSObj(o);\n  }\n\n  function cachedHashString(string) {\n    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n    if (hash === undefined) {\n      hash = hashString(string);\n      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n        stringHashCache = {};\n      }\n      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n    }\n    return hash;\n  }\n\n  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n  function hashString(string) {\n    // This is the hash from JVM\n    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n    // the string.

If the selector is nested the number of columns of its parent element should be passed as an argument as well.\\n///\\n/// @param {List} $span\\n///   A list containing `$columns`, the unitless number of columns the element spans (required), and `$container-columns`, the number of columns the parent element spans (optional).\\n///\\n///   If only one value is passed, it is assumed that it's `$columns` and that that `$container-columns` is equal to `$grid-columns`, the total number of columns in the grid.\\n///\\n///   The values can be separated with any string such as `of`, `/`, etc.\\n///\\n///   `$columns` also accepts decimals for when it's necessary to break out of the standard grid. E.g. Passing `2.4` in a standard 12 column grid will divide the row into 5 columns.\\n///\\n/// @param {String} $display [block]\\n///   Sets the display property of the element. By default it sets the display propert of the element to `block`.\\n///\\n///   If passed `block-collapse`, it also removes the margin gutter by adding it to the element width.\\n///\\n///   If passed `table`, it sets the display property to `table-cell` and calculates the width of the element without taking gutters into consideration.
